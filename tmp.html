<strong>Agencies are required to report across all CVEs listed in CISAâ€™s Known Exploited Vulnerability Catalog regardless of remediation timelines. 
<br><br>
Please refer to the catalog for specific remediation deadlines to ensure agency compliance with BOD 22-01 requirements.
<br><br>
Please complete this section by following the instructions below: 
<br><br>
Note: The responses to each CVE must be "agency-wide" - please confirm this by checking the box above the grid.
<br><br>
To respond to the CVEs via excel spreadsheet: 
<br><br>
<br>1) Download the appropriate template by clicking "Download" on the upper-right hand corner of the grid. This will download the CVE list including any data already entered/submitted in an excel format.
<br>2) Open the file and manually enter the "Appended Total Findings" for the specified CVE(s). This is required if "CDM Total Findings" is N/A.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1) If data is available under "CDM Total Findings" but wish to append the total, a "Finding Justification" will be required for the specified CVE(s).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2) Optionally describe any challenges or constraints for any CVE(s).
<br>3) Once the file is complete, ensure the changes are saved.
<br>4) Within CyberScope, click "Choose File", select the completed file, then click "Upload".
<br><br>
Note: By uploading a completed file, this will overwrite any previously entered/uploaded data.
<br><br>
To respond to the CVEs manually: 
<br><br>
<br>1) Select "Edit" next to the specified CVE.
<br>2) Enter the "Appended Total Findings" for the given CVE.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1) If data is available under "CDM Total Findings" but wish to append the total, a "Finding Justification" will be required for the CVE.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2) Optionally describe any challenges or constraints for the CVE.
<br>3) Once completed, click the "Update" button. Repeat these steps for the remaining CVEs.
<br><br>
Note: "Actual Total Findings" are the values being submitted to CISA. It is a combination of the "CDM Total Findings" and the "Appended Total Findings", with the "Appended" values superseding the "CDM" values.
